# Script-Ware-Mac-Themes-Albert
More themes for Script-Ware Mac.
To insert the themes, Simply go to Finder>Documents>Script-Ware>Themes>Paste the theme.
The .swmtheme is the themes.
Currently there are 10 themes. 8 themes got added today! Download the Working Script-Ware Themes.ZIP to get all the working themes by theLMGN, Trill, and myself.

WARNING!!! COPPER.SWMTHEME IS BROKEN. DO NOT USE COPPER.SWMTHEME UNTIL I FIX. I fucked up the code and I can just remake it and it'll take like 10 seconds but I'm too lazy to do it lol

I think there is a limit on how many swmthemes you can have at once.

I'll be making more in a few weeks.
