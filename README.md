More themes for Script-Ware Mac.
To insert the themes, Simply go to Finder>Documents>Script-Ware>Themes>Paste the theme.
The .swmtheme is the themes.
Currently there are 10 themes. 8 themes got added today! Download the Working Script-Ware Themes.ZIP to get all the working themes by theLMGN, Trill, and myself.


I think there is a limit on how many swmthemes you can have at once.

I'll be making more in a few weeks.

The code is made by theLMGN and I just changed some stuff up to change the colors.
